# Ocean City Gallery
A gallery-style website utilizing CSS, HTML, and JavaScript showing off pictures from my recent trip back home with my family.

All the pictures used were taken by me, and I was given permission by my family members pictured to use them. I have not edited the pictures at all or blurred background faces, since they were all taken in a public space (the beach & boardwalk in Ocean City, NJ).

This repository is hosting a coding project for my portfolio, shamiltonc.github.io.

I am not providing a license because I do not wish this repository to be distributed, manipulated, or used for commercial purposes. If you have any questions about that, please contact me here on GitHub.
